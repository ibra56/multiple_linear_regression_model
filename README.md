# multiple_linear_regression_model
The notebook implements a Multiple Linear Regression model. The model is trained and tested on a dataset to predict profit based on various input features. It also includes a scatter plot comparing the actual profit values with the predicted ones. This visualization aids in understanding the performance and accuracy of the implemented model.
